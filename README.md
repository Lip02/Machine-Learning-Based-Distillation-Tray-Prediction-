Machine Learning-Based Distillation Tray Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict distillation tray performance in chemical engineering processes. The goal is to improve the efficiency of distillation operations by accurately predicting key parameters of tray performance, such as efficiency, pressure drop, and liquid holdup, based on various operational and design inputs.
